# Test

clone
check status: git status
add file: git add filename.ipynp
commit file: git commit -m "message"
push file: git push -u origin master (for files in the master directory)

if creating a new branch:
first: 
git checkout -b <YOUR-NETID>/complete-question-x/1 where you replace <YOUR-NETID> with your netID and x with the question you have yet to complete. You can now see that you should be on a different branch by typing git branch -av
then:
git push git push --set-upstream origin <YOUR-NETID>/complete-question-x/1
before any of this do the add and commit first
